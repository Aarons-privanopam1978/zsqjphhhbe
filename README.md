Just got back from 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Where There Is Love, There Is No Darkness, and dude, I'm wiped. Like, who knew two hours of sitting could feel like I just finished a whole circus act? 😂 But wow, that   left me with so many feels, you know?

First off, can we talk about the soundtrack? It’s like they knew exactly which tunes would hit all my emotions like a perfect juggling sequence. Seriously, they nailed it. You gotta 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   just for that, no joke.

Honestly though, by the end, I was like, “Why am I not crying?” Thought I’d spill my popcorn tears all over the place, but nah. Maybe I'm just turning into a stoic trapeze artist these days. Anyway, the whole friendship bit got me thinking – it's like how we survive with this crazy circus life because we’ve got each other’s backs, even when we’re tired and covered in glitter.

> Oh, and remind me why they can't make a   without some cliché love scenes. I mean, I’m all for romance but it’s like, come on, make it less predictable than me dropping a baton! Still, that bit with the streetlight... almost poetic, almost! 😏 

By the way, totally unrelated, but I went for popcorns, and guess who managed to spill soda down their pants? This guy. So there’s that.

Gotta say though, the visuals were just off the chart. Like those elaborate aerial shots? Made me dizzy in the best possible way. Felt like I was right back on our aerial rig. You should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   even if just for that experience... plus you might catch some costume inspo for our next gig. Just saying!

function funFact() {return I love popcorn;}
  
Anyway, next time you're in town, let's catch a matinee or maybe just crash with some old DVDs. I mean, nothing like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a sappy tale after a full day of acrobatics, right? So many feels, imma need a nap soon. Catch you later, buddy! 💤
